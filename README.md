- 👋 Hi, I’m @jahknem
- 👀 I’m interested in networks, automation, all things `python`, `bash`ing my head against `rust` and learning the _needful_
- 🌱 I’m currently learning network automation with ansible and napalm
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all of the above
- 📫 How to reach me: Probably via mail, but it may sometimes take me a day or two to respond. Have patience: jan ( at ) kuehnemund ( dot ) io
